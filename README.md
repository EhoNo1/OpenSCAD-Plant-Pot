# OpenSCAD-Plant-Pot
A basic OpenSCAD script that generates a simple 3D-printable plant pot. It was created when a client when a client needed a replacent 3D printed plant pot for one that was broken.

Feel free to use this script wherever and however you want. If you make improvements please share them here, though that is not required.
